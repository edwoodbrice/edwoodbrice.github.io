# <span style="color:maroon">About Me</span>
* <span style="color:black">I graduated with a B.S. [Informatics & Data Science](https://www.cics.umass.edu/informatics) degree at the [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.umass.edu) in May 2019. Data science is concerned with the ‚Äú[...] extraction of knowledge from large volumes of data that are structured or unstructured [...]‚Äù (Vasant Dhar 3) across disciplines including computer science, statistics, biology, healthcare and etc. Informatics encompasses how one can effectively make use of collected data for the sake of answering meaningful questions that are produced by natural phenomenons, consumers, students, and researchers alike.</span> 

* <span style="color:black"> I am primarily interested in the research, technological, and commercial facets of informatics and data science. I intend to use my studies to acquire skills and experiences that are comprehensive and practical. Ultimately, I will use them to support my academic and professional careers that follow. Additionally, they will also impact my efforts  to promote the wellbeing of people and the efficiency of the world around us.</span> 

* <span style="color:black"> I am currently working as a Junior Data Scientist at MassMutual in the Data Science Development Program (DSDP) in Amherst, Massachusetts. Through the DSDP, I intend to develop my data science career so that I can effectively handle today‚Äôs ever-growing list of computational challenges. I also mentor younger undergraduate peers in STEM through the UMass [STEM Ambassadors Program](https://www.stemapumass.org/) (STEM AP).</span> 

* <span style="color:black"> In my free time, I love to explore entreprenurial avenues that make use of my skills. I also take great interest in developing tech ventures that make things easier for people. When I'm not doing that, I enjoy traveling, trying out new recipies and breaking personal records at the gym! </span> 

* <span style="color:black"> Recently, I've been  working on making perfect [s√≤s pwa nwa](http://loveforhaitianfood.com/sos-pwa-nwa-black-bean-puree-2/). It is typically served with white rice and it's my absolute favorite meal üçõ </span>
