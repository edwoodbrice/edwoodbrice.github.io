#<span style="color:maroon">About Me</span>
* <span style="color:black">I am pursuing a B.S. [Informatics](https://www.cics.umass.edu/informatics) degree with a concentration in data science at the [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.umass.edu). Data science is concerned with the ‚Äú[...] extraction of knowledge from large volumes of data that are structured or unstructured [...]‚Äù (Vasant Dhar 3) across disciplines including computer science, statistics, biology, healthcare and etc. Informatics encompasses how one can effectively make use of collected data for the sake of answering meaningful questions that are produced by natural phenomenons, consumers, students, and researchers alike.</span> 

* <span style="color:black"> I am primarily interested in the research and technological oriented facets of informatics and data science. I intend to use my studies to acquire skills and experiences that are comprehensive and practical. Ultimately, I will use them to support my academic career, professional careers that follow, and efforts to promote the wellbeing of people and the world around us.</span> 

* <span style="color:black"> I'm currently an undergraduate peer advisor in the [College of Information and Computer Sciences](https://www.cics.umass.edu/) (CICS) for the informatics major. I also mentor younger undergraduate peers in STEM through the UMass [STEM Ambassadors Program](https://www.stemapumass.org/) (STEM AP).</span> 

* <span style="color:black"> In my spare time, I love to explore entreprenurial avenues that make use of my skills. I also enjoy cooking and trying out new recipies! I am currently working on making perfect [s√≤s pwa nwa](http://loveforhaitianfood.com/sos-pwa-nwa-black-bean-puree-2/). It is typically served with white rice and it's my absolute favorite meal üçõ </span>
